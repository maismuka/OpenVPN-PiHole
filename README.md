## Introduction

What is PiHole : A black hole for Internet advertisements. The Pi-hole acts as a Domain Name System (DNS) server, something that sits in-between you and the internet. This allows the Pi-hole to intercept any outgoing or incoming DNS requests and can block or pass certain domains from accessing your device, keeping your computer and other devices safe from ads

What is OpenVPN : OpenVPN is an open-source commercial software that implements virtual private network (VPN) techniques to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities.
